A few months ago I was complaining to a close friend about my current dead-end job and how I felt burned out on it. I have been working at a warehouse that specializes in lighting fixtures and light-bulbs for the past six years. When I started it was a pretty great job because It was mindless and I liked turning my brain off for eight hours. After December my outlook on my life shifted when i turned thirty, I started thinking more about what my long term goals were and how I wanted a job that stimulated my brain. My friend that I was always complaining to is a Senior developer and he asked me if I had any interest in coding. The truth is, I never thought about it before. I didn't really know what went into coding so I didn't have any interest whatsoever. My friend then continued to explain why he thought it would be a smart career/life change for me and I was getting more and more interested as he explained it. I loved how he was describing the struggle and the reward that comes with coding. How it isn't uncommon that you have to crawl through the mud and really push yourself to get what you want out of coding. For most people I assume that must be a turnoff but right now in my life I am craving a job that is different and a challenge everyday. 

It takes me awhile to wrap my head around major life decisions so I spent the next month or two researching different schools and what route would be best for me if I were to commit. I then stumbled on a video of Avi talking about the Flatiron School on YouTube and I liked how the Flatiron School approached things. Two weeks followed and it was the only thing I could think about, so I decided to apply and enroll.  Here I am...crawling through the mud and loving the struggle!
